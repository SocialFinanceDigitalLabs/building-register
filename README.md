# Social Finance Building Register

We need to keep a register of staff in the building in case of fire or emergency. 
At the moment, this is kept on paper in the reception. 

The idea of this website is to make it quicker and easier for regular staff to 
sign-in and out, in particular for those arriving by bike and using the other
entrance.

We can also use it to notify staff members in the building of any day-to-day 
issues, and send out notifications in case of emergencies.

## Design ideas

* Simple sign in, using phone, email or SF account
* Long-lasting session cookie / identity cookie to make sign in quick
* Reminder to sign out towards the end of the day
* Admin view showing who is currently in the building

To be considered:

* Data retention of records
* Non-intrusive reminders to make data accurate
* Those who are signed-in can see other who are signed in? 
  * Community pressure? 
  * An accurate in-office slack channel?
